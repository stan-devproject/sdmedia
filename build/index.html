      <h3 class="about__title">Hello from Matt and Andrew!</h3>

      <p class="about__text">We have made SideDish Media (though we didn’t know it then) back in school, when we were just eleven. Over the years, the plans for the company developed, and finally, at the age of twenty-two, we opened for business!</p>
      <p class="about__text">We have tested all forms of advertising, including social media ads. It soon became apparent that the most effective approach for restaurants, bars and hotels was Google Ads, hands-down. So that’s what we focused on – because we want big results for the clients!</p>
      <p class="about__text">Now, SideDish Media is a team of seven enthusiastic individuals, working together from their offices in Soho Square, London, to make a huge difference for businesses across the country. We plan to take SideDish Media and make it the UK’s main meal when it comes to marketing.</p>
